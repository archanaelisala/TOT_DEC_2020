		<p class="indent">Some of these controls were to be put into place to prevent errors or incidents from occurring in the first place, some were to identify an incident had occurred or was in progress, and some were designed for after the event to limit the extent of damage and aid swift recovery. These <em>preventative, detective,</em> and <em>corrective</em> controls can work together to reduce Joe’s ability to further his side of the great Doughnut Fallout.</p>

<p class="note"style="background-color: #D2C8C6; border-radius: 5px; padding-left: 5px;"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know preventive, detective, and corrective measures. Examples of each include authentication (preventative), alarm bells for unauthorized access to a physical location, alerts on unauthorized access to resources, audits (detective), and backups and restore options (corrective). You will definitely be asked about them, in one way or another.</p>

		<p class="indent">This effort spurred a greater focus on overall preparation and security. Bob’s quick action averted what could have been a total disaster, but everyone involved saw the need for better planning and preparation. Bob and management kicked off an effort to identify the <span id="page_17" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>systems and processes that were critical for operations. This <em>business impact analysis (BIA)</em> included measurements of the <em>maximum tolerable downtime (MTD),</em> which provided a means to prioritize the recovery of assets should the worst occur. Bob also branched out and created Orca Pig’s first set of plans and procedures to follow in the event of a failure or a disaster—security related or not—to get business services back up and running. His <em>business continuity plan (BCP)</em> included a <em>disaster recovery plan (DRP),</em> addressing exactly what to do to recover any lost data or services.</p>

		<p class="indent">Bob also did some research his management should have, and discovered some additional actions and groovy acronyms they should know and pay attention to. When putting numbers and value to his systems and services, the <em>ALE (annualized loss expectancy)</em> turned out to be the product of the <em>ARO (annual rate of occurrence)</em> and the <em>SLE (single loss expectancy)</em>. For his first effort, he looked at one system and determined its worth, including the cost for return to service and any lost revenue during downtime, was $120,000. Bob made an educated guess on the percentage of loss for this asset if a specific threat was actually realized and determined the <em>exposure factor (EF)</em> turned out to be 25 percent. He multiplied this by the asset value and came up with an SLE of $30,000 ($120,000 × 25%). He then figured out what he felt would be the probability this would occur in any particular 12-month period. Given statistics he garnered from similarly protected businesses, he thought it could occur once every five years, which gave him an ARO of 0.2 (one occurrence / five years). By multiplying the estimate of a single loss versus the number of times it was likely to occur in a year, Bob could generate the ALE for this asset at $6000 ($30,000 × 0.2). Repeating this across Orca Pig’s assets turned out to provide valuable information for planning, preparation, and budgeting.</p>

		<p class="indent">At the end of this effort week, Bob relaxed with a Maker’s Mark and an Arturo Fuente on his back porch, smiling at all the good security work he’d done and enjoying the bonus his leadership provided as a reward. Joe stewed in his apartment, angry that his work would now be exponentially harder. But while Bob took the evening to rest on his laurels, Joe went back to work, scratching and digging at OP’s defenses. “One day I’ll find a way in. Just wait and see. I won’t stop. Ever.”</p>

<p class="note"style="background-color: #D2C8C6; border-radius: 5px; padding-left: 5px;"><strong>NOTE</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oftentimes security folks tend to get caught up in the 101-level items and catch words we all know. We make sure we investigate vulnerabilities, manage risks, and establish policies, while we sometimes ignore the biggest issue we have right in front of us—the users. ECC calls this out in User Behavior Analytics (UBA). UBA is a process of tracking user behaviors themselves, and extrapolating those behaviors in light of malicious activity, attacks, and frauds. There are behavior-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) out there, but don’t overlook UBA in your own security efforts.</p>

		<p class="indent"><span id="page_18" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Now, wasn’t that better than just reading definitions? Sure, there were a few leaps, and Bob surely wouldn’t be the guy doing ALE measurements, but it was better than trying to explain all that otherwise. Every italicized word in this section could possibly show up on your exam, and now you can just remember this little story and you’ll be ready for almost anything. But although this was fun, and I did consider continuing the story throughout the remainder of this book (fiction is <em>so</em> much more entertaining), some of these topics need a little more than a passing italics reference, so we’ll break here and go back to more “expected” writing.</p>

		<h4 class="h4"><strong>CIA</strong></h4>

		<p class="noindent">Another bedrock in any security basics discussion is the holy trinity of IT security: confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA). Whether you’re an ethical hacker or not, these three items constitute the hallmarks of security we all strive for. You’ll need to be familiar with two aspects of each term in order to achieve success as an ethical hacker as well as on the exam: what the term itself means and which attacks are most commonly associated with it.</p>

		<p class="indent"><em>Confidentiality,</em> addressing the secrecy and privacy of information, refers to the measures taken both to prevent disclosure of information or data to unauthorized individuals or systems and to ensure the proper disclosure of information to those who are authorized to receive it. Confidentiality for the individual is a must, considering its loss could result in identity theft, fraud, and loss of money. For a business or government agency, it could be even worse. The use of passwords within some form of authentication is by far the most common measure taken to ensure confidentiality, and attacks against passwords are, amazingly enough, the most common confidentiality attacks.</p>

		<p class="indent">For example, your logon to a network usually consists of a user ID and a password, which is designed to ensure only you have access to that particular device or set of network resources. If another person were to gain your user ID and password, they would have unauthorized access to resources and could masquerade as you throughout their session. Although the user ID and password combination is by far the most common method used to enforce confidentiality, numerous other options are available, including biometrics and smartcards.</p>

<p class="note"style="background-color: #D2C8C6; border-radius: 5px; padding-left: 5px;"><strong>EXAM TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be careful with the terms <em>confidentiality</em> and <em>authentication</em>. Sometimes these two are used interchangeably, and if you’re looking for only one, you may miss the question altogether. For example, a MAC address spoof (using the MAC address of another machine) is considered an <em>authentication attack.</em> Authentication is definitely a major portion of the confidentiality segment of IT security.</p>
