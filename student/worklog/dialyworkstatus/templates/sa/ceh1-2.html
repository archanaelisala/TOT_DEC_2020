	<strong><p class="indent">First, if you’ve never taken a certification-level exam, I wouldn’t recommend this one as your virgin experience. It’s tough enough without all the distractions and nerves involved in your first walkthrough. When you do arrive for your exam, you usually check in with a friendly test proctor or receptionist, sign a few things, and get funneled off to your testing room. Every time I’ve gone it has been a smallish office or a closed-in cubicle, with a single monitor staring at you ominously. You’ll click START and begin whizzing through questions one by one, clicking the circle to select the best answer(s) or clicking and dragging definitions to the correct section. At the end there’s a SUBMIT button, which you will click and then enter a break in the time-space continuum—because the next 10 seconds will seem like the longest of your life. In fact, it’ll seem like an eternity, where things have slowed down so much you can actually watch the refresh rate on the monitor and notice the cycles of AC current flowing through the office lamps. When the results page finally appears, it’s a moment of overwhelming relief or one of surreal numbness.</p>

	<p class="indent">If you pass, none of the study material matters and, frankly, you’ll almost immediately start dumping the stored memory from your neurons. If you don’t pass, everything matters. You’ll race to the car and start marking down everything you can remember so you can study better next time. You’ll fly to social media and the Internet to discuss what <span id="page_4" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>went wrong and to lambast anything you didn’t find useful in preparation. And you’ll almost certainly look for something, someone to blame. Trust me, don’t do this.</p>

	<p class="indent">Everything you do in preparation for this exam should be done to <em>make you a better ethical hacker,</em> not to pass a test. If you prepare as if this is your job, if you take everything you can use for study material and try to learn instead of memorize, you’ll be better off, pass or fail. And, consequentially, I guarantee if you prepare this way your odds of passing <em>any</em> version of the test that comes out go up astronomically.</p>


	<p class="indent">The test itself? Well, there are some tips and tricks that can help. I highly recommend you go back to the introduction and read the sections “The Examination” and “The Certification.” They’ll help you. A lot. Here are some other tips that may help:</p>


	<u><p class="bullt" style="background-color:yellow">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not let real life trump EC-Council’s view of it. There will be several instances somewhere along your study and eventual exam life where you will say, aloud, “That’s not what happens in the real world! Anyone claiming that would be stuffed in a locker and sprayed head to toe with shaving cream!” Trust me when I say this: real life and a certification exam are not necessarily always directly proportional. On some of these questions, you’ll need to study and learn what you need for the exam, knowing full well it’s different in the real world. If you don’t know what I mean by this, ask someone who has been doing this for a while if they think social engineering is passive.</p>


	<p class="bull" style="background-color:yellow">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the bathroom before you enter your test room. Even if you don’t have to. Because, trust me, you do.</p>

	<p class="bull" style="background-color:yellow">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use time to your advantage. The exam now is split into sections, with a timeframe set up for each one. You can work and review inside the section all you want, but once you pass through it you can’t go back. And if you fly through a section, you don’t get more time on the next one. Take your time and review appropriately.</p>

	<p class="bull" style="background-color:yellow">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make use of the paper and pencil/pen the friendly test proctor provides you. As soon as you sit down, before you click START on the ominous test monitor display, start writing down everything from your head onto the paper provided. I would recommend reviewing just before you walk into the test center those sections of information you’re having the most trouble remembering. When you get to your test room, write them down immediately. That way, when you’re losing your mind a third of the way through the exam and start panicking that you can’t remember what an XMAS scan returns on a closed port, you’ll have a reference. And trust me, having it there makes it easier for you to recall the information, even if you never look at it.</p>


	<p class="bull" style="background-color:yellow">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trust your instincts. When you do question review, unless you absolutely, positively, beyond any shadow of a doubt know you initially marked the wrong answer, <em>do not change it</em>.</p>


	<p class="bull" style="background-color:yellow">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the questions at face value. I know many people who don’t do well on exams because they’re trying to figure out what the test writer <em>meant</em> when putting the question together. Don’t read into a question; just answer it and move on.</p>


	<p class="bullb" style="background-color:yellow">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span id="page_5" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Schedule your exam sooner than you think you’ll be ready for it. I say this because I know people who say, “I’m going to study for six months and then I’ll be ready to take the exam.” Six months pass and they’re still sitting there, studying and preparing. If you do not put it on the calendar to make yourself prepare, you’ll never take it, because you’ll never be ready.</p></u>


	<p class="indent">Again, it’s my intention that everyone reading this book and using it as a valuable resource in preparation for the exam will attain the certification, but I can’t guarantee you will. Because, frankly, I don’t know you. I don’t know your work ethic, your attention to detail, or your ability to effectively calm down to take a test and discern reality from a certification definition question. All I can do is provide you with the information, wish you the best of luck, and turn you loose. Now, on with the show.</p>
